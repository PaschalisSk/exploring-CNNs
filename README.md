# Exploring CNNs

The second assignment for the Machine Learning Practical class during my AI MSc in the University of Edinburgh (2018/19). It was awarded a grade of 79/100 (A3). Further information can be found in the report file.

## Abstract

As is the case with many neural network hyperparameters, the number of kernels in layers of
convolutional neural nets is usually determined
ad-hoc. This paper explores the performance
gains of a common industry practice, increasing the number of kernels in deeper layers, in the
context of EMNIST, with regards to max-pooling,
striding, and dilation. Our experiments indicate
that all three approaches perform almost equally
better, with up to 0.95% increase in test set accuracy
